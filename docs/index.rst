py/cuTAGI's documentation
====================

What is py/cuTAGI?
---------------

py/cuTAGI is an open-source Bayesian neural networks library that is based on the Tractable Approximate Gaussian Inference (TAGI) theory.
It supports various neural network architectures such as fully-connected, convolutional, and transpose convolutional layers,
as well as skip connections, pooling and normalization layers. cuTAGI is capable of performing different tasks such as supervised,
unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. This library has a python API called pyTAGI that allows users to easily use the C++ and CUDA libraries.
